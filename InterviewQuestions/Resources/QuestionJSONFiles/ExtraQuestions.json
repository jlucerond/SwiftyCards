 "question" : "What is an example of a closed range? A half-open range?",
 "answer" : "A closed range includes both the start and end value. A half-open range includes the start value and up to, but not including, the end value.",
 "answerCode" : "let rangeA = 1...10\nlet rangeB = 11..<20\n\n// rangeA contains 10 numbers\n// rangeB contains 9 numbers"

 {
 "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
 "question" : "What is the minimum number of values inside of a closed range? A half-open range?",
 "answer" : "A closed range must have at least one value inside. A half-open range can have zero values inside. This may influence which one you should choose to use in a for loop.",
 "answerCode" : "let rangeA = 1...1\nlet rangeB = 1..<1\n\nprint(rangeA.count)\n// prints 1\n\nprint(rangeB.count)\n// prints 0"

 "question" : "What is a wildcard symbol used for?",
 "answer" : "A wildcard or _ is used to signify that the variable or constant that it is replacing is not needed. It is commonly used to skip the external parameter name in a function.",
