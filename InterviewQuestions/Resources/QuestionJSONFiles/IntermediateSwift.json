  "question" : "What is a recursive function and what must you be careful of when using one?",
  "answer" : "A recursive function is a function that calls itself. However, if a function calls itself, you need to be sure that there is a way to exit the function, otherwise you will enter an infinite loop.",

  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What is subscripting and what data types support it?",
  "answer" : "Subscripts enable you to query instances of a type by writing one or more values in square brackets after the instance name. Classes, structs, and enums can all use subscripts. The two most common uses of subscripts are with arrays and dictionaries."

  },
  
  {
  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What are the differences between structs and classes?",
  "answer" : "Probably the most significant difference between the two is that structs are value-based and classes are reference-based. Structs also get a pre-made initializer with all  In addition, classes have the following abilities, while structs do not:\n- Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.\n- Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.\n- Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.\n- Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance."

  "questionCode" : "class Person {\n   var name: String\n   var age: Int\n}\n\nPerson(name: 'Aaron', age: 34)",
  "answer" : "Because classes do not get pre-made initializers and the properties do not have default values, the code will not compile until an initializer gets added or Person changes from a class to a struct."

  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What's the difference between a function and a method in Swift? A constant/variable and a property?",

  },
  
  {
  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using classes vs reference?",
  "answer" : "There are many reasons why you want to choose one type or the other (or a combination of both), but because structs are value types, they work on the stack and have the advantages of speed and changes to one struct not affecting a copy of that struct. If you are making items that represent unique objects and want a change in one area to alter other areas in your code, you might prefer classes. (My $0.02: start with structs and change to classes when needed)"

  "answer" : "1) Class\n\n2) Struct\n\n3) Struct\n\n4) It depends! We might say 'I have the same book as you', but unless you went 50/50 with a friend you don't technically own the same book\n\n"

  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What is a type property?",
  "answer" : "Often called a class property or static property, these are properties that are not called on an instance of a class, but the class itself. One example is Double.pi, which is a value not associated with a specific double. It wouldn't make sense to say that 1.5 should have a property called pi, but it does make sense that pi is associated with the type Double."

  "question" : "What is the purpose of using enumerations (enums)?",
  "answer" : "An enum defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code. Rather than use a string in several places in your code and risk a spelling error causing a run-time error, by using an enum, you can ensure that errors get checked at compile-time."

  "category" : "Intermediate Swift",
  "question" : "What is a protocol?",
  "answer" : "A protocol defines a contract of methods, properties, and other requirements.

Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol."

  "answer" : "The Comparable protocol is used for types that have an inherent order, such as numbers and strings, and allows you to use >, <, >=, and <= operators on custom types. Many types in the standard library already conform to the Comparable protocol. Because it inherits from Equatable, if you want to conform to Comparable, your custom type must also define the == operator."
